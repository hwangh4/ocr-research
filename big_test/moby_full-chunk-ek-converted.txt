‘This fundamental thing settied, the next pointis, in what internal
respect does the whale differ from other fish, Above, Linnzous has given
you those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood:
whereas, all other fish are jungles and cold blooded

Next: how shal we define the whale, by his obvious extemials, so as
‘conspicuously to tabel him for al ime to come? To he short, then, 2
‘whale is _a spouting fish with a horizontal tail_. There you have him,
However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded
‘meditation. A walrus spouts much fike a whale, but the walrus is not a
fish, because he is amphibious. But the fast term of he definition is
sili more cogent, as coupled with the first. Aimost any one must have
noticed that all the fish familiar to tandsmen have not a fat, but a
vertical, or up-and-down tail, Whereas, among spouting fish the tail,
though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal
position.

By the above definition ofwhat a whale is, Ido by na means exclude
from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherio Mentified
with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; sor, on the other
‘hand, fink with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as

alien.” Hence, ail the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish

‘must be included in this pround-plan of Cetatogy. Now, then, come the
grand divisions of the entire whale host.

‘iam aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and
Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fsh of the Coffins of Nantucket) are
included by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-tish
are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths afrivers,
and feeding on wet hay, and especialy as they do not spout, Fdany
their credentials as whales; and have presented them with their
passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.

First: According to magnitude | divide the whales into three primary
BOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shail comprehend them
ail, both small and iarge.
