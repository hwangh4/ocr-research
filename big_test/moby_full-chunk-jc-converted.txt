“Bom in a ferry-boat! That's queer, too. But want to know what
country you were born in, cook”

“Didn't say de Roanoke country?” he cried sharply.

*No, you didn't, cook; but Fil tell you what I'm coming to, cook. You
must go home and be born aver again, you don't know how to cook a
whale-steak yet

“Bress my soul, Ft oonk nader ane.” he growled, angrily, turing
round to depart

“Come back, cook —here, hand me those tongs—now take that bit ofsteak
there, and tell me ifyou think that steak cooked as it should be? Take

Faintly smacking his withered tips over it fora moment, the ofd negro
mutiered, “Best cooked ‘teak teher taste: joasy, berry jousy.”

“Cook,” said Stubb, equaring himself once more; “da you betong to the

“And you have onos in your life passed a holy church In Cape-Town,
where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as,

‘and tell me such a dreadful tie as you did just now, eh?” said Slubb,
“Where do you expect io go to, cok?”

“Go to bed berry soon, he mumbled, hatf-tuming as he spoke.

“Avast heave tol! mean when you die, cook. Its an awful question.
Now what's your answer?”

“When dis old brack man dies.” said the negro slowly, changing his
whole air and demeanor, “he hisseif won't go nowhere; but some bressed
‘angel will come and feich him.”

“Fetch him? How? In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah? And fetch

“Up dere,” said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and
keeping itthere very solemnly,
