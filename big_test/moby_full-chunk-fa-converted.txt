‘Conceming a this, itis much to be deplored that the mastheads of a
southem whale ship are unprovided with those enviable ite tents or
pulpits, cafled _crow's-nests_, in which the fook-ouls ofa Greenland
whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In
the freside narrative of Captain Sieet, entitled “A Voyage among the
Icebergs, in quest ofthe Greeniand Whale, and incidentally or the
re-discovery of the Lost losiandic Colanies of Old Greeniand,”in this,
admirable volume, afl standers of mast-heads are furnished with 3
‘charmingly circumstantial account ofthe then recently invented
_erow's-nest_ofthe Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sieet's
‘good craft. He called ithe _Sieet’s crow's-nest_, in honor of

‘imself, he being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all
‘idiculous faise delicacy, and holding that f we call our own children
after our own names (we fathers being the original inventors and
patentees), so ikewise should we denominae after ourselves any other
apparatus we may beget. in shape, the Sleet's crow's-nestis something
like a large tierce or pipe: itis open above, however, where itis,
fumished with a movable side-ccreen to keep fo windward of your head
ina hard gale. Being fied on the summit ofthe mast, you ascend into
itthrough a little trep-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or

side next the stem of the ship, sa comfortable seat, with a tocker
underneath for umbrellas, comiocters, and coats. In fonts a eather
zack, in which to keep your speaking trumpat, nipe, telescope, and
other nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his
‘masthead in this crow's-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a
‘ile with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask

and shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, oF

vagrant sea unicoms infesting those waters. for you cannot
supoessfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the
‘water, but fo shoot down upon them is a very diferent thing. Now, it

was plainly a labor of fove for Captain Steet to describe, as he does,

ail the lite detailed conveniences ofhis crow's-nest, but though he

50 enlarges upon many ofthese, and though he teais us to a very
scientific account af his experiments in this crow's-nest, with a smatl
‘sompass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors
sesuiting from what is catled the “tocal attraction” ofall binnacie
‘magnets, an error asoribable to the horizontal vicinity ofthe iron in

the ship's planks, and in the Glacier's case, perhaps, to there having
bean so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew: F say, that though
the Captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his

feared “binnacle deviations,” “azimuth compass observations,” and
“approximate errors,” he knows very wel, Captain Sieet, that he was
not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fall
being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished title
ease-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow’s nest, withio
easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, tgreatly admire and
ven love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet Hake it

very il of him that he should so utterly ignore that ease-hottle,

seeing what a faithful fiend and comforter it must have been, while

with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics
