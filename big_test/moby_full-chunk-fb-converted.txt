But twe Southern whale-fichers are not so snugly housed aloft as
‘Captain Steet and his Greantandmen were: yet that disadvantage is
greatly counter-baianced by the widely contrasting serenity of thase
seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float, For one, Hised

chat with Queequeg, oF any one else aff duty whom [ might find there:
then ascending a litte way further, and throwing a fazy eg over the
top-sall yard, take a preliminary view ofthe watery pastures, and so

Letme make a clean breast ofit here, and frankly admit that tkept

And tet me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of

sentiment in tar and blubber, Childe Harold not unfrequently perches
‘nimself upon the mast head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship,

and in moody phrase ejacuiates:—

“Roll on, thou deep and dark blue oosan, roll Ten thousand
biubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain”

Very often do the capiains of such ships take those absent-minded young
philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient

“interest” in the voyage: haifhinting thal they are so hopelessly lost

to all honorable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would

rather not see whales than otherwise. But all in vain; those young
Pratonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect, they are
