‘enough in offering battle to the Greeniand or Right whale, would
perhaps—either from professional inexperience, or incompeteney, oF
timidity, dectine a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there

are plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations nat
sailing under the American flag. who have never hosiilely encountered

the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is

‘estricied to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North

seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish

fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southem

‘whaling. Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale
anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of these prows,
which stem hie.

And as ifthe now tested reality of his might had in former legendary
times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book

‘naturalists —Olassen and Povelson—declaring the Sperm Whale not only to
‘be 2 consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be

0 incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood.

Nor even down to so ate a time as Cuvier's, were these or alarost

similar impressions effaced. For in his Natural Histary, the Baron

fimsetf affms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks

included) are “struck with the most lively terrors“ and “often in the

vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.

So that overawed by the rumors and portents conceming him, not a few

ofthe Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce tong

‘warfare; such men protesting that although other teviathans might be
hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point ance at such an appanion

inevitably to be tom into a quick eternity. On this head, there are

some remarkable documents that may be consulted

Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face ofthese things
were teady to give chase to Moby Dick, and a stil greater number who,
chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the
specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious
accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the hatte if
offered.

‘One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at fast coming to be linked
with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitously inclined, was
the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubjquitous: that he had
