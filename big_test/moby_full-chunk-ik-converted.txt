continually girdied by amphitheatrical heights; hare and there from
some Jucky point of view you will caich passing glimpses of the

profiles of whales defined along the undulating dges. But you must be
a thorough whaleman, fo see these sights; and not ony that, but you
wish fo relurn tp such a sight again, you must be sure and take the
‘exact intersecting jatitude and fongitude of your frst stand-point,

‘else co chance-tike are such observations ofthe hills, that your
precise, previous stand-point would require a isborious re-diseovery;
{ike the Soloma islands, which stil remain incognita, though ance
‘igh-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicied them,

Nor when expandingly Hited by your subject, can you fail to trace out
great whales in the stay heavens, and boais in pursuit of them, a5,

tocked in baie among the clouds. Thus al the North have I chased
Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright
points that frst defined him to me. And beneath the effulgent

CHAPTER 58. Brit,

Steering north-eastward from the Crazetts, we fell in with vast meadows
ofbit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale
largely feeds. For leagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that
‘we seemed to be sailing trough boundless felds of fipe and golden
wheat.

‘On the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from
the attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly
swam through the bait, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that
wondrous Venetian bling in their mouths, was in that manner separated
from the water that escaped at the tip.

‘As morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their
soythes through the ‘ong wet grass of marshy meads; even so these
monsters swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound: and Jeaving
behind them endless swaths of biue upon the yellow sea."

“That part of the sea known among whalemen as the “Brazil Banks’ does
not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there
being shatiows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable
meadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually
