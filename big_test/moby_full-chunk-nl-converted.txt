‘have what the proprietors call “the only perfect specimen of a
Greenland or River Whale in the United States” Moreover, ata place in
Yorkshire, England, Burton Constable by name, a certain Sir Clifford
‘Constable has in his possession the skeleton ofa Sperm Whale, but of
moderate size, byno means ofthe full-grown magnitude of my friend
King Franquo's.

In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons
belonged, were ariginally claimed by their proprietors upon simitar
grounds. King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted It; and Sit
Ciiford, because he was ford ofthe seignories of those parts. Sir
Clifford's whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a great
chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in ali his boay
cavities—spread out his ribs tke a gigantic fan—and swing aif day upon
this lower jaw. Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and
shutters: and a footman will show round fulure visitors with a burch of
keys at his side. Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep

at the whispering gallery In the spinal column; threepence to hear the
‘echo in the haliow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for the unrivalled
‘view from his forehead

‘The skeleton dimensions I shail now proceed to set down are copied
verbatim from my right arm, where Hhad them tattooed; as in my wild
wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving
such valuable stalisties, But as | was crowded for space, and wished

the other paris of my body to remain a blank page for a poem Iwas then
‘composing—at teas, what untatiooed parts might remain—tdid not
trouble mysetf with the odd inches; nor, indeed, shoutd inches at ait
enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.

CHAPTER 103, Measurement of The Whale's Skeleton

In the first place, twish to lay before you a particular, plain
statement, touching the fiving bulk ofthis leviathan, whose skeleton
we are briefly to exhibit. Such a statement may prove useful here.

According to a careful calculation thave made, snd which | partly base
upon Capiain Scoresby's estimate, of seventy tons for the largest sized
Greenland whale of sixty feet In fength: according to my careful
caleulation, tay, a Sperm Whale of the fargest magnitude, between
eighty-five and ninety feet in tength, and something less than forty

{eet inits fullest circumference, such a whate wil weigh at least

ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would
considerably outweigh the combined population ofa whole vilage of ane
thousand one hundred inhabitants,

Think you not then that brains, like yoked calle, should be put to
this leviathan, to make him at ail budge to any landsman's imagination?
