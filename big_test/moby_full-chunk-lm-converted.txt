hereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the
customary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle
of singular magnificence saluted us.

But here be It premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with
which offate they have been hunted over ail four oceans, the Sperm
Whales, instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached
companies, as in former times, are now frequently met with in extensive
herds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost
seem as ifnumerous nations ofthem had sworn solemn league and
‘covenant for mutual assistance and protection. To this aggregation of
the Sparm Whale into such immense caravans, may be imputed the
irournstanee that even in the best cruising grounds, you may now
sometimes sail for weeks and months together, without being greeted by
a single spout and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems
thousands on thousands,

Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and
forming a great semicircle, embracing one haif ofthe teval horizon, a
eontinuous chain ofwhale jets were up-playing and sparkling in the
‘noon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right
Whale, which, dividing at top, fail over in two branches, tike the

cleft drooping boughs ofa willow, the single forward-slanting spout of
the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually
rising and failing away to leeward,

Seen from the Pequod’s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of
the sea, this host of vapory spouls, individually curting up into the

ait, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed
like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried
ofa balmy autumnal moming, by some horseman on a height.

As marching armies approaching an untiiendly defile in the mountains,
‘accelerate their march, all eagemess to place thal perilous passage in,
‘their ear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the
plain; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward
through the straits: gradually contracting the wings of their

semicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but slit crescentic centre

‘Crowding ail sal the Pequod pressed after them; the hapooneers
‘handling their weapons, and foudly cheering from the heads of their yet
suspended boats. fthe wind only held, tte doubt fad they, that
‘chased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy
into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their

number. And who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby
Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped
\white-elephant in the coronation procession of tye Siamese! So with
stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed atong, driving these leviathans
before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, toudly
irecting attention to something in our wake.
