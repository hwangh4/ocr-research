had abided for now some sixty years or more. And this itwas, this same
unaccountable, cunning fife-prineiple in him; this it was, that kept

all the time to keep himself awake.

CHAPTER $08. Ahab and the Carpenter.
‘The Deck—First Night Watch,

(Carpenter standing before his viee-bench, and by the tight oftwo
tantems busily fling the Ivory joist for the teg, which joist is

firmly fixed in the vice. Slabs of ivory, leather straps, pads, screws,
and various foots ofall sorts iying about the bench. Forward, the red

Dratthe fle, and drat the bone! That is hard which should be soft,
‘and that is soft which should be hard. So we go, who file old jaws and
